# **Algorithm and Programming - Final Project: ToDo-List Application**

The To-Do List Application helps you to keep track and remind yourself, as the user of the app, of your upcoming activites. The To-Do List App aims to also help users by helping them not only to remember the tasks they have in hand to complete, but also to help the users be more organised and self-aware in carrying out their activities throughout their day.

## How to Use the Program

![FULL WINDOW](https://github.com/KennyKd/ToDo-List-App/blob/main/images/Screenshot_full_window.png?raw=true)

The app is made up of **5** main features:
- Add new tasks
- View existing tasks
- Search for certain tasks by filtering
- Mark a task complete/incomplete
- Delete selected tasks

### **Add New Tasks**

![ADD TASK](https://github.com/KennyKd/ToDo-List-App/blob/main/images/Screenshot_add_task_entry.png?raw=true)

A new task can be added by giving it a **name**, followed by a **reminder** for when the user wants to be reminded about their task. The name of the task are not limited by its length of string. The reminder uses a format for the selection of date and time (as shown in the screenshot above).

### **View Existing Tasks**

![VIEW TASK](https://github.com/KennyKd/ToDo-List-App/blob/main/images/Screenshot_task_list.png?raw=true)

All of the added and stored tasks are viewed in this list box. Each entry are displayed in the format of:
[**Task_Name**] - [**Status**] (Reminder: [**YYYY:MM:DD**] [**HH:MM**]).
(YYYY: year, MM: month, DD: day), (HH: hour, MM: minute)

### **Search For Certain Tasks by Flitering**

Every entry of tasks stored in the list consists of 3 parts: its **name**, **status**, and the **reminder date & time**. With this knowledge, we can choose which part of the entrries' information we want to select from and enter certain keywords which associates with the type of entries we are looking for.

![OTHER FEATURES](https://github.com/KennyKd/ToDo-List-App/blob/main/images/Screenshot_other_buttons.png?raw=true)

A task can be marked **'Comeplete'** or **'Incomplete'** when it is selected in the list box, then the **'Mark Complete'** button is pressed (to mark the selected task **complete**) or the **'Mark Incomplete'** button is pressed (to mark the selected task **incomplete**).
A task can also be deleted by selecting a task and pressing the **'Delete Task'** button (removing the task from the list).
Press the **'Exit'** button for when you are done with the program and would like to close the program.
